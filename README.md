# PySAGES

PySAGES (Python Suite for Advanced General Ensemble Simulations) is an Python
implementation of [SSAGES](https://ssagesproject.github.io) with support for GPUs.

**NOTICE**: This is in early stages of development, expect breaking changes.

## Installation

Currently, there is only support for
[HOOMD-blue](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue) and
[OpenMM](http://openmm.org/), but gradual support for other molecular dynamics engines is
planned (for instance, for all engines already supported by the original SSAGES).

You first need to install one of the following plugins depending on your molecular
dynamics engine

 - For HOOMD-blue visit [HOOMD-dlpack Plugin](https://github.com/SSAGESLabs/hoomd-dlext).
 - For OpenMM go to [OpenMM](https://github.com/SSAGESLabs/openmm-dlext).

PySAGES also depends on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax/), follow their installation
guide to set it up. *NOTE:* make sure you manually install jaxlib before PySAGES.
Depending on your local setup, you will have to install the jaxlib CPU version or the CUDA compatible flavor.

To test GPU support HOOMD-blue, HOOMD-dlext and JAX need to be built or installed with
GPU support.

## Usage

PySAGES provide a straightforward interface to setup Collective Variables and Enhaced
Sampling methods to you MD simulations. See the documentation to learn more.

If you want to learn more, you can also head over to the `examples` subfolder,
which contains scripts for running different HOOMD-blue and OpenMM biased simulations
