We have document PySAGES with the help of Sphinx.
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
You can locally build the documentation by installing sphinx and GNUmake: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
After you can run `make html` in PySAGES/docs/ to build the documentation.
The final result can be explored with a browser by opening PySAGES/docs/build/html/index.html
Do not build in the parent directory of PySAGES. In that case sphinx tries to use the local `pysages` directory as the python module, but that fails.
Always install PySAGES first and build the documentation based on that installation.
This command, can be a bash short cut for this: `cd .. && pip install . && cd - && make html`
Building the documentations also requires the python packages listed at docs/requirements.txt
Or you can look up the latest version of the documentation on: https://pysages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Note to developers: Sphinx builds the documentation from the installation the python interpreter finds.
If you have locally changed the documentation in the source code, install pysages first before rebuilding the documentation.
