Getting Started
===============

PySAGES is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing simulations.
For an approachable start we prepared examples in Google Colab documents, which provide easy access to a working simulation environment and GPU hardware.
For an example of using PySAGES with HOOMD-blue, check out `this <https://colab.research.google.com/github/SSAGESLabs/PySAGES/blob/main/examples/hoomd-blue/Umbrella_Integration.ipynb>`__ example for simple umbrella integration.
If you are working with OpenMM, we offer `this <https://colab.research.google.com/github/SSAGESLabs/PySAGES/blob/main/examples/openmm/Harmonic_Bias.ipynb>`__ notebook, which explores the free energy landscape of the conformational space of alanine dipeptide via harmonic biasing.
Using the notebooks enables you to get started with PySAGES without installation.
For a productive deployment, we recommend a full installation.

We offer more examples, in the form of both Google Colab notebooks and for fully installed PySAGES, in the GitHub repository `examples <https://github.com/SSAGESLabs/PySAGES/tree/main/examples>`__.
